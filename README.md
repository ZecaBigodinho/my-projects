ðŸš€ Project: Educational Management Platform (Classroom App)
Status: Completed

Description
This project was developed with the goal of creating an educational platform for schools, enabling the digital assignment of tasks, tests, and content delivery. The solution was designed to modernize the classroom, eliminating the need for paper and the excessive use of the blackboard for activities.

Key Features
Direct Support Channel: A private chat for communication and support between teachers and students.

Class Community: An exclusive group chat for students of the same class to interact and collaborate.

Lesson Repository: A feature allowing teachers to upload links to recorded lessons from YouTube, centralizing the content.

Activity Module: A system for teachers to create and send assignments, which students can receive and complete directly on the platform.

My Role and Key Learnings
This project was developed in a team of two. My main responsibility and technical challenge was implementing the permissions system and designing the database architecture.

The biggest challenge was creating a software architecture that differentiated access permissions: when logging in as a teacher, the system grants full control over the content "windows," allowing materials to be added and removed. When logging in as a student, the user only has viewing access and the ability to interact with the posted content. This challenge allowed me to gain practical experience with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

The main technical takeaway was the use of MongoDB. Managing the non-relational database to store diverse dataâ€”such as chat messages, activities, images, and linksâ€”was a challenging experience, but one that greatly deepened my understanding of data modeling and the importance of a well-planned structure to ensure the application's integrity and performance.

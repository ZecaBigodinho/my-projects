🚀 Project Portfolio in English
### Hello! 👋

Welcome to my project repository! This space was created to centralize and showcase the work I have developed and documented in English.

The goal is not only to demonstrate my technical skills but also to create an accessible resource for the developer community who, like me, prefers to consume and create content in our language.

### 📂 Repository Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder. Inside each one, you will find a specific README.md with all the details about that application, including:

Project description and its objectives.

Technologies used.

Main functionalities.

Instructions for local installation and execution.

Lessons learned and challenges faced.

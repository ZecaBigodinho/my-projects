### ðŸ“± Digital Canteen Project
A complete and functional application developed in Flutter with a serverless backend on Firebase. The project simulates an ordering system for a school canteen (CantinaSenac), allowing students to place orders and the canteen staff to manage operations in real-time.

### ðŸš€ Overview
The project was built incrementally, starting with a local mock database and evolving into a complete and robust cloud solution, integrating Firebase's core services. The application distinguishes between two user roles (students and canteen administrators), each with its own dedicated interface and permissions.
